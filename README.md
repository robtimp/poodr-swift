Example code from Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz translated to Swift

As I work through Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby, I'm creating Swift versions of the code to help increase 
my understanding and see how these patterns and techniques would apply to a language I work with daily.

Chapters will be added regularly as I work through the book. Feedback is welcomed!
